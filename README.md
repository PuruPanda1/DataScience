This repository will help you to follow the basic roadmap to learning data science as well as I will provide you free genuine resoureces for the same.

# RoadMap

## Mathematics and Statistics:

Develop a strong foundation in mathematics, including linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.
Study statistics to understand data analysis, inference, and probability distributions.

## Programming:

Learn a programming language commonly used in data science, such as Python or R. Python is widely preferred in the industry due to its versatility and vast library support.
Familiarize yourself with data manipulation libraries like Pandas, data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and other essential libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

## Data Manipulation and Cleaning:

Learn how to clean, preprocess, and handle data effectively. Understanding data quality and dealing with missing values is crucial.

## Data Exploration and Visualization:

Master data visualization techniques to analyze and present insights from the data effectively.
Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and interactive visualization libraries like Plotly.

## Machine Learning:

Gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised techniques.
Learn about model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.

## Big Data and Distributed Computing:

Explore technologies like Apache Hadoop and Spark for working with big data and distributed computing.

## Databases and SQL:

Understand how to work with databases and perform queries using SQL. This skill is essential for extracting and manipulating data.

## Data Engineering:

Familiarize yourself with data engineering concepts, including data pipelines, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and data warehousing.

## Domain Knowledge:

Acquire domain-specific knowledge. Whether it's finance, healthcare, marketing, or any other area, understanding the context and specific challenges will make you a more effective data scientist.

## Version Control:

Learn version control systems like Git to efficiently manage and collaborate on code projects.

## Communication and Storytelling:

Develop your communication skills to present complex technical concepts and insights in a clear and understandable manner to non-technical stakeholders.

## Real-world Projects:
Work on various data science projects to apply your knowledge and build a strong portfolio. Participation in hackathons and Kaggle competitions can also be beneficial.
